    <h1>About Tupie</h1>
    <p class="intro">
        <strong>Tupie</strong> comes from the Swahili words <em>Tupa</em> (throw) and <em>Mie</em> (give it to me).
        Instead of throwing away useful items, you can give them a new life by sharing with someone in need.
    </p>

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
                Tupie helps reduce waste and promotes community support by connecting people who have unwanted items with 
                those who truly need them. Our platform empowers sustainable living and strengthens local communities.
            </p>
            
            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>✔️ List items you no longer need</li>
                <li>✔️ Browse available items near you</li>
                <li>✔️ Request and reuse instead of buying new</li>
            </ul>
